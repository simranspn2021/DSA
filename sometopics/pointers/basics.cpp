//we have symbol table that has mapping and will direct to the address when we want to fetch data 
//never forget to initialze the pointer if u want to have pointer then always initiaze otherwise it will point to some garbage value
//* this is derefernce operator
//sizeof pointer is 8 bytes 
//for both integer array and chaarcter array the implementation of cout is differnt bcoz 
//for integer array if we write name of array then it will print the addresss of first elemnt of an arry whereas in case of 
//character array if we write the name of the array the it will print the whole string 
//when we pass the pointer in a function and  thenupdate the value of that pointer then 
//it will not change but in case we change the value that is hold by pointer that can change 
//we can ccreate double pointer by using int** ptr2=i;
//learn more about pointers from the google for interview
